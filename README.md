## Teleform

Built for the Build Together SF Hackathon in June 2024.

Teleform lets users effortlessly collect information from customers over the phone using AI-driven text-to-speech (TTS) and speech-to-text (STT) technology.

When users call over the phone, an AI Agent talks to them on behalf of a business or organization and captures a summary of the call.

The inspiration for Teleform is Google Forms, which lots of non-technical users use for everyday tasks.
